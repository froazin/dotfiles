# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! It contains configuration files and scripts to set up and customize my development environment across different systems.

This repository is designed to compliment my [devcontainers](https://github.com/froazin/devcontainers) project. The scripts in this repository have a hard dependency on my [Script Development Kit (sdk)](https://github.com/froazin/devcontainers/blob/main/features/src/sdk/README.md) dev container feature.

Feel free to use and adapt these configurations for your own setup.

## Usage

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/froazin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

# 2. Run the install script
chmod +x ./src/install.sh 
bash src/install.sh

# 3. Profit.
```

Happy coding! :rocket:
