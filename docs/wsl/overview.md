# WSL provisioning

How the files in [`src/wsl/`](../../src/wsl/) build an Ubuntu 26.04 WSL instance from scratch on its first boot. It's for engineers changing `.wslconfig` or the cloud-init user-data. The meta-data keys have their own doc, [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md).

## Overview

`src/wsl/` holds three files that the user copies to their Windows profile. Nothing in the repository copies them:

| File | Copied to | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`.wslconfig`](../../src/wsl/.wslconfig) | `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig` | Settings for the WSL 2 virtual machine, shared by every instance |
| [`Ubuntu-26.04.user-data`](../../src/wsl/Ubuntu-26.04.user-data) | `%USERPROFILE%\.cloud-init\Ubuntu-26.04.user-data` | The Jinja cloud-config. Generic, and the same for every user |
| [`Ubuntu-26.04.meta-data`](../../src/wsl/Ubuntu-26.04.meta-data) | `%USERPROFILE%\.cloud-init\Ubuntu-26.04.meta-data` | A template the user fills in with their identity and choices. See [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md) |

The user-data installs packages, writes system config, bridges Windows tools into Linux, creates the user and runs the dotfiles' [`install.sh`](../../src/install.sh) for that user and for root. It holds nothing personal: every personal value comes from the meta-data.

This flowchart shows how the files reach the instance:

    accDescr: The user copies the three files into their Windows profile. WSL reads .wslconfig. cloud-init's WSL datasource reads the user-data and meta-data, renders the Jinja template and runs the cloud-config, which runs install.sh as the user and as root.

```

## How it works

### Finding the files

cloud-init's WSL datasource loads one user-data file, picked by instance name first, and only `<Instance>.meta-data`, which must contain `instance-id`. Both files are named for `Ubuntu-26.04`, the default name `wsl --install Ubuntu-26.04` gives. A test instance installed with `--name ci-test` needs copies named `ci-test.user-data` and `ci-test.meta-data`. The datasource merges nothing except Ubuntu Pro's `agent.yaml`.

cloud-init runs once, on first boot, and Ubuntu's out-of-box experience (OOBE), `/usr/lib/wsl/wsl-setup`, waits for it.

### Rendering

The first line, `## template: jinja`, makes cloud-init render the file with Jinja before it parses the YAML. The header block reads every meta-data key from `ds.meta_data`, normalises and validates it and sets the variables the rest of the file uses. [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md) describes each one. It also builds paths with the `workspace` macro, which turns a clone URL into `workspaces/<host>/<owner>/<repo>`, so this repository's clone lands in `~/workspaces/github.com/froazin/dotfiles`.

Jinja runs with `trim_blocks` on and `lstrip_blocks` off, so every `{% %}` and `{# #}` tag sits at column 0. An indented tag would leave its indentation behind and break the YAML.

### Stages

cloud-init runs its modules in a fixed order, not in the order the keys appear in the file. This flowchart shows the modules the user-data uses, in the order Ubuntu's `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` lists them (observed):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: cloud-init modules the user-data uses
    accDescr: The init stage writes the non-deferred files and creates the user. The config stage sets the locale, adds the GitHub CLI apt source and writes the runcmd script. The final stage installs packages, writes the deferred files and runs the runcmd script.
    wf["write_files"] -->|then| users["users_groups"]
    users -->|config stage| locale["locale, apt_configure"]
    locale -->|then| runcmd["runcmd writes its script"]
    runcmd -->|final stage| pkg["package_update_upgrade_install"]
    pkg -->|packages installed| deferred["write_files_deferred"]
    deferred -->|then| scripts["scripts_user runs the runcmd script"]
```

- **Init stage:** `write_files` writes the system files, then `users` creates the user with uid 1000, zsh, passwordless sudo and a locked password.
- **Config stage:** `locale` sets `en_GB.UTF-8` and apt adds the GitHub CLI source and its key. The `runcmd` module then writes the commands out as a script.
- **Final stage:** apt updates, upgrades and installs `packages`. The deferred files go into the user's home. The `runcmd` script runs last.

Anything that needs a package, or a group a package creates such as `libvirt`, is in `runcmd` or a deferred file. The files in the user's home are deferred because `write_files` runs before `users_groups` creates the user.

### System files

| Path | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/wsl.conf` | Turns on systemd, remounts `/` shared at boot and keeps the Windows `PATH` out (`appendWindowsPath=false`). Has no `[user]` section, because the OOBE writes `default=` |
| `/etc/apt/preferences.d/github-cli` | Pins `gh` from `cli.github.com` at 600, above the 510 Ubuntu Pro gives ESM |
| `/etc/adduser.conf` (appended) | Adds a user the OOBE creates to `users`, `kvm` and `libvirt` |
| `/etc/containers/nodocker` | Stops `podman-docker`'s `docker` wrapper printing its "Emulate Docker CLI using podman" notice |
| `/etc/profile.d/browser.sh`, `/etc/environment.d/90-browser.conf` | Set `BROWSER=/usr/local/bin/start` |
| `/etc/systemd/system/disable-swap.service` | Runs `swapoff -a`, because WSL attaches swap before systemd starts, even with `swap=0` |
| `/etc/systemd/system/make-root-rshared.service` | Runs `mount --make-rshared /` before `sysinit.target`, backing up the `[boot]` command podman needs |
| `/etc/systemd/user/podman.socket.d/10-not-root.conf` | `ConditionUser=!root`, so root's user manager doesn't start a second rootful podman API |
| `/usr/local/bin/start` | Opens a URL or file with its Windows handler through PowerShell `Start-Process`. Used as `$BROWSER` |

With a username, two deferred files go into the user's home: `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/allowed_signers`. [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md) says when each is written.

### runcmd

cloud-init writes `runcmd` out as one `#!/bin/sh` script with no `set -e`, so each entry runs whatever the others return. The order still matters:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    accTitle: runcmd order
    accDescr: runcmd links the Windows tools, enables system units and the global podman socket, sets zsh for new users and root, then either sets up the named user and runs install.sh for the user and root, or runs install.sh for root from a temporary clone.
    links["ln -sfn Windows tools"] -->|then| units["systemctl daemon-reload, enable --now disable-swap, make-root-rshared"]
    units -->|then| global["systemctl --global enable podman.socket"]
    global -->|then| sys["systemctl enable --now podman.socket"]
    sys -->|then| virsh["virsh net-autostart default"]
    virsh -->|then| shells["DSHELL and usermod -s for root"]
    shells -->|username set| prep["usermod -aG libvirt, mkdir workspaces"]
    prep -->|runuser -l| tools["uv, pulumi, nvm, claude, ant"]
    tools -->|runuser -l| ext["code --install-extension, gh extension install"]
    ext -->|runuser -l| userinstall["install.sh as the user"]
    userinstall -->|runuser -l root| rootinstall["install.sh as root"]
    shells -->|no username| tmp["install.sh as root from a mktemp clone"]
```

- The global `podman.socket` enable comes before the first `runuser -l`. That entry starts the user's systemd manager, which reads global wants only when it starts.
- `DSHELL=/usr/bin/zsh` and root's `usermod -s` run only when `/usr/bin/zsh` is executable, so a failed package install can't leave a login shell that doesn't exist. Root's shell is set before root's install, so the zsh module's `$SHELL` check sees zsh and doesn't warn.
- The user's install puts `~/.local/bin` and `~/.pulumi/bin` on `PATH` itself, because `~/.zshenv` doesn't exist yet. Without that, `install.sh` can't find `claude` and skips the claude module.
- Root's install uses the absolute path `/home/<user>/workspaces/...`, because `~` under `runuser -l root` is `/root`.
- Without a username, root's copy comes from a shallow clone in a `mktemp -d` directory, which is deleted afterwards.

## Interfaces

- **Windows tools:** `runcmd` links `code`, `op`, `ssh`, `ssh-add` and `clip` from fixed paths under `/mnt/c/` into `/usr/local/bin/`. A link to a missing program is left dangling.
- **The dotfiles:** the user-data expects [`src/install.sh`](../../src/install.sh) at a fixed path in this repository, and `~/.zshenv` from the [zsh module](../zsh/overview.md) to put `~/.local/bin` and `~/.pulumi/bin` on `PATH` later. `~/.zshenv` also exports `BROWSER=/usr/local/bin/start` when that file is executable.
- **Workspaces:** `~/workspaces/<host>/<owner>/<repo>` is the layout the zsh `ws` picker reads. The user-data clones nvm and this repository there.

## Errors and logging

- One bad name in `packages` fails the whole package install. `qemu-kvm` is a virtual package and isn't listed for that reason.
- A failing `runcmd` entry doesn't stop the rest. Each VS Code and gh extension has its own entry for this reason.
- Rejected meta-data values are reported with `printf` lines in `runcmd`, as [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md#reporting-rejected-values) describes. They go to cloud-init's output log (inferred).
- `install.sh` logs as described in the [installer doc](../installer.md), and exits non-zero when a module fails.

## Security and privacy

- The repository is public. The user-data holds no personal usernames, emails, signing keys, hostnames or `/mnt/c/Users/<name>/` paths: they come from the user's private meta-data. The only account name in it is this repository's own URL.
- Only validated meta-data values reach shell commands. `username` is the exception: it's trusted as written (see [WSL meta-data](meta-data.md#limits)).
- The GitHub CLI apt key is embedded in the file, with its fingerprint in a comment, rather than fetched at boot.
- `uv`, `pulumi`, Claude Code and `ant` are fetched over HTTPS and run as the user. Their integrity rests on those hosts and TLS.
- `/usr/local/bin/start` passes its target to PowerShell in an environment variable through `WSLENV`, never in the command, so the target is never parsed as code.
- The user named by `username` gets passwordless sudo, and their password is locked.

## Decisions

- **Native cloud-init modules over custom scripts.** Files, users, apt sources and packages use their modules. `runcmd` holds only what has no module.
- **Installers run as the user** with `runuser -l`, so the tools live in the user's home and update themselves. nvm is cloned and checked out at its newest tag, and `ant` is unpacked with `tar -m` so zsh notices the new binary and regenerates its completion.
- **`systemctl --global` instead of `--user`.** `runcmd` has no user bus. The `ConditionUser=!root` drop-in keeps the global enable out of root's user manager, which `sudo su` starts.
- **Root's shell through `usermod`.** `users:` skips existing users, root included, and would lock root's password.
- **Windows tools by link, not the Windows `PATH`.** With the Windows `PATH` appended, `xdg-open` finds `explorer.exe` and bypasses `$BROWSER`. The links bring in only the five tools listed.
- **`WSL_DISTRO_NAME` from `wslpath`.** VS Code's launcher installs into `~/.vscode-server` only when it's set, and `runuser` clears it. The value only labels the remote.
- **No `power_state` or `package_reboot_if_required`.** They restart the instance in the middle of the OOBE. The README tells the user to restart it with `wsl --terminate` once cloud-init finishes instead.

## Validation

[`validate.sh`](../../.claude/skills/validate-wsl-user-data/scripts/validate.sh) renders the template with `cloud-init devel render` against mock meta-data, runs `cloud-init schema` on each result and checks it. Its cases and checks are listed in the [validate-wsl-user-data skill](../../.claude/skills/validate-wsl-user-data/SKILL.md). Add a case for every new meta-data key or conditional, including the key being unset.

It doesn't prove a real first boot. Only a throwaway instance, as the README describes, exercises the datasource, the OOBE and the package installs.

## Limits

- `.wslconfig` holds fixed values, such as `processors=12` and `memory=32GB`, and applies to every WSL 2 instance on the machine. Another machine may need different values.
- The user-data runs once. Changing it doesn't change an existing instance.
- The Windows tool paths are fixed. A tool installed elsewhere gets a dangling link.
- `ant`'s architecture is chosen only for `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
- Without a username, the user the OOBE creates gets zsh and the groups, but none of the tools, extensions or dotfiles. The README lists the commands to finish it.
